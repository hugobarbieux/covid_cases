# covid_cases

This repo is aimed to give you the tools to generate quickly and transparently databases and graphs about Covid-19 cases.
The number of cases chages every day (and even faster).
If you follow this link https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide
you will find a new dataset every day with the updated figures.

R operations here are basic, I didn't do that to push the boundaries of datajournalism, so feel free to submit any improvements.
I'd also suggest that you use it mainly to export subset data and visualise them in Flourish for example.
But it helps to keep graphs updated very quickly.

The only thing you have to do is download the new file once it is published on the website above.
