# covid_cases

This repo is aimed to give you the tools to generate quickly and transparently databases and graphs about Covid-19 cases.
The number of cases chages every day (and even faster).
If you follow this link https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide
you will find a new dataset every day with the updated figures.

I have written down here some R functions to parse efficiently this dataset.

The only thing you have to do is download the new file once it is published on the website above.
